# File
#     etc/config.sh/ADIOS
#
# Description
#     Setup for ADIOS include/libraries (usually ThirdParty installation).
#     Sourced from OpenFOAM-<VERSION>/etc/bashrc
#
#     To disable its use:               adios_version=adios-none
#     For system-wide installations:    adios_version=adios-system
#
#     For central installations not located under ThirdParty:
#       1. use adios-system
#       2. and provide full path for ADIOS_ARCH_PATH
#
# Note
#     Since ADIOS is a static library build, the libraries are renamed
#     for the appropriate MPI. Eg, libadios_openmpi-system
#
#     Can also disable by renaming/removing this file or by creating an empty
#     file with the same name at a user or site location.
