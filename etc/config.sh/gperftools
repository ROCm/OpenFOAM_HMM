#     For system-wide installations:    gperftools_version=gperftools-system
#
#     For central installations not located under ThirdParty:
#       1. use gperftools-system
#       2. and provide full path for GPERFTOOLS_ARCH_PATH
#
# Note
#     When _foamAddLib is unset (eg, called from makeGperftools):
#       - gperftools_version variable are retained.
#       - the LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH are not adjusted.
