## Getting the code

Links to all code packs are available on https://dl.openfoam.com. For OpenFOAM-v2112:

- https://dl.openfoam.com/source/latest/
- Source: https://dl.openfoam.com/source/v2112/OpenFOAM-v2112.tgz
- ThirdParty: https://dl.openfoam.com/source/v2112/ThirdParty-v2112.tgz

## OpenFOAM&reg; Quick Build Guide

Prior to building, ensure that the [system requirements][link openfoam-require]
are satisfied (including any special [cross-compiling][wiki-cross-compile]
considerations), and source the correct OpenFOAM environment.
For example, for the OpenFOAM-v2112 version:
```
source <installation path>/OpenFOAM-v2112/etc/bashrc
```
e.g. if installed under the `~/openfoam` directory
```
source ~/openfoam/OpenFOAM-v2112/etc/bashrc
```


## Preliminaries

The [third-party][repo third] directory includes a
[readme][link third-readme] and additional information about
[requirements][link third-require] and a more detailed
[build guide][link third-build].

Some known build issues related to specific compiler and VTK library versions
can be found in the [$WM_PROJECT_DIR/doc/BuildIssues.md][link openfoam-issues]
file.

If you need to change the default versions for third-party libraries,
or use system libraries for some components, please some additional
information about the [config structure][wiki-config].

## Compile OpenFOAM

The compilation process is self-contained and will compile and install
all OpenFOAM code and dependencies.

- Test the system readiness (optional, not supported for cross-compilation)
```
foamSystemCheck
```
- Change to the main OpenFOAM directory ($WM_PROJECT_DIR).
  If this fails, the environment is not correctly configured.
```
foam
```
- Compile OpenFOAM
```
./Allwmake -s -l
```
- This will start the build process, where the `-s` option is used to reduce
  the level of output, and the `-l` option to record the output in a log file.
  To see all available options use `./Allwmake -help`
- In case you need to stop the compilation, continue later by running
`./Allwmake` again.

## Compile OpenFOAM faster

For faster compilation, users should take advantage of multi-processor
machines when building the code. This is supported directly by `wmake`
and the `Allwmake` scripts. For example,
```
wmake -j               # Use all cores
wmake -j 8             # Use specified number of cores
```
It can also be helpful to use the builtin queuing (the `-queue`
option), which collects subdirectories and dispatches to make in
larger chunks.

The following compilation sequence can be useful:
```
./Allwmake -j -s -q -l
```
This compiles with all cores (-j), reduced output (-s, -silent), with
queuing (-q, -queue) and logs (-l, -log) the output to a file such as
`log.linux64GccDPInt32Opt` for later inspection.

If you use the `-k` option (`-keep-going` = ignore errors) to compile
as much as possible on the first pass, be certain to follow that with
second pass (without the `-k` option) at a later stage to ensure that
you haven't missed any error messages.

## Post-compilation steps

- Open a new shell and source the OpenFOAM environment to see all
  changes (refer to top of page).
- Validate the build (not supported for cross-compilation) by running
```
foamInstallationTest
```
- test any given tutorial case. For example,
```
foamTestTutorial -full incompressible/simpleFoam/pitzDaily
```
- Note: the tutorial test can also be done manually:
```
# Create the user "run" directory:
mkdir -p "$FOAM_RUN"
# Change to the user "run" directory:
run
# Copy tutorial
cp -r "$FOAM_TUTORIALS"/incompressible/simpleFoam/pitzDaily ./
# Run the tutorial
( cd pitzDaily && blockMesh && simpleFoam )
```

### ParaView

OpenFOAM ships with ParaView sources for post-processing OpenFOAM
field results. However, it will [often be sufficient][FAQ ParaView]
to use the paraview version distributed with
the operating system or a [binary package][download ParaView]
and avoid additional compilation complexity.

If you do wish to compile ParaView from source, it is recommended
that you do so ***after*** completing an initial compilation of OpenFOAM.
This gets the process started much more quickly. At a later stage,
the OpenFOAM visualization module can be compiled for a particular
ParaView version _without_ recompiling OpenFOAM itself.

If you decide to compile in two passes, you only need to execute the
top-level `Allwmake` a second time. Do **not** use `wclean` to force a
complete rebuild! This is unnecessary.

More details in the [ThirdParty build guide][link third-build].
