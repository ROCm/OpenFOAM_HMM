Synthetic turbulence inflow tests
======================

The following three synthetic turbulence inflow boundary conditions are
examined through a single-cell-domain smooth-wall plane channel flow setup:

- turbulentDFSEMInlet
- turbulentDigitalFilterInlet variant=digitalFilter
- turbulentDigitalFilterInlet variant=reducedDigitalFilter

The input statistics are obtained from:

    Moser, R. D., Kim, J., & Mansour, N. N. (1999).
    Direct numerical simulation of turbulent channel flow up to Reτ=590.
    Physics of fluids, 11(4), 943-945.
    DOI:10.1063/1.869966

from which the input first-/second-order turbulence statistics data for the
smooth-wall plane channel flow at ReTau=395 were used.

The data is available online from (Retrieved: 21-06-2019):

Serial executing (comment out 'parallelRun'):

./Allrun

Parallel (decompositionMethod=scotch) executing (comment out 'serialRun'):

./Allrun

The script will run the test case, and collect the plots and samples into
the 'results' directory.
