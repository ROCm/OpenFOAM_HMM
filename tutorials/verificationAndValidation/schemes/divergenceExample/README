Divergence scheme test
======================

Various divergence schemes are examined on a 2-D structured mesh, where a
passive scalar is convected at 45deg to the mesh co-ordinate system using a
uniform flow velocity.  Executing:

./Allrun

will update the system/fvSchemes file to use each scheme listed in the file
system/schemesToTest and perform the test using the scalarTransportFoam solver.
A test file for each run is generated that can be used to compare the predicted
scalar profile against the exact solution.
